Tests needed

-- pkg/client --- test FetchVia against a server returning compressed content.
   (fix in 3fa6d69405f036308931dd36e5070b2b19dbeadf without a new test)

-cmd/camput/
	-verify that stat caching works. verify that -filenodes does create the permanode even if the file was already uploaded (and cached) in a previous run.

-- blobserver/{cond,replica,remote,shard} have no tests. should be easier now
   that test.Fetcher is a full blobserver? see encrypt's nascent tests for
   examples.

-- app engine integration tests (before we make a release, for sure,
   but probably in presubmit)

-- cross-compiling to freebsd and windows etc still works.

-- pkg/auth -- not enough tests. see regression at
   https://camlistore-review.googlesource.com/#/c/556/1

-- blobserver.WaitForBlob, and integration tests for the http handlers
   for long-polling on Enumerate and Stat
