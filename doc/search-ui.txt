The User Interface's "Search" box understands simple boolean expressions of
"operator:value" expressions stitched together with "and" and "or" words,
separated by spaces.

Negation is achieved by prepending a minus sign: -is:landscape will match
with pictures of not landscape ratio.

For example

    after:"2010-01-01" and before:"2010-03-02T12:33:44" or loc:"Amsterdam"

will return all images having "modtime" between before and after or having
location in Amsterdam.

Usable operators:
    after:
    before:
    format:
    has:location
    height:
    is:image
    is:landscape
    is:pano
    is:portrait
    loc:            loc:"new york, new york" or "loc:new york, new york" both work.
